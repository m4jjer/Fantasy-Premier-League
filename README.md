Fantasy Premier League

This is a Jupyter Notebook (will add Python file) script that pulls player, team and gameweek data from the official Fantasy Premier League API.

I first wrote this during the 24/25 season so it may need updating, will take a look at it shortly.

I'll be building a Power BI report that I'll then use to help me with my squad selections etc.
